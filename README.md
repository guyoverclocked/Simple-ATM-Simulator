# Simple-ATM-Simulator
Simple ATM Simulator is a Python-based project that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing funds. This project is part of my learning process, aimed at enhancing my programming skills and understanding of control flow in Python.

## Features

- **View Balance**: Allows the user to view their current account balance.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Enables the user to withdraw a specified amount from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
- **Deposit Funds**: Lets the user deposit a specified amount into their account.
- **Exit**: Allows the user to exit the ATM system.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script in your preferred Python environment.

2. **Choose an Option**: Upon running, the ATM menu will be displayed with the following options:
   - `1. View Balance`: Displays the current account balance.
   - `2. Withdraw Funds`: Prompts the user to enter an amount to withdraw.
   - `3. Deposit Funds`: Prompts the user to enter an amount to deposit.
   - `4. Exit`: Ends the program.

3. **User Input**: Input the corresponding number (1-4) to choose an option.

4. **Withdraw/Deposit**: If you choose to withdraw or deposit funds, enter the amount when prompted. The program will update and display your new balance.

5. **Exit**: Choose option `4` to exit the program.

## Example

```bash
Welcome to the ATM
1. View Balance
2. Withdraw Funds
3. Deposit Funds

Please select an option (1-4): 1
Your current balance is $500.
